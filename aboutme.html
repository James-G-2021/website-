<div><p>Prior to attending the <a href="https://wearecodenation.com/" target="_blank">Code 
    Nation</a> training course I was working within the financail sector at<br>
    the second largest trading platform and brokerage in England. I was resbonsible for placing<br>
    trades on behalf of clients within the scope of the London stock exchange, the main stock and ETF<br>
    exchange in the UK.In additon to this my general day to day remedial work would be to assist clients<br>
    moving equities, pension pots and ISA's ect from other providers to our client base and inform them how<br>
    particular financail products would work.</p></div>

       finnace and investment world you are always looking for high growth stocks, compaines who pioneer, compaines<br> 
       who push the boundaries such as Telsa, Uber, Apple and Alphabet changing they way we live through inervation.<br>
      human evalution has been greatly increased as a by product of our technological evalution and advancement wether<br>
     in biotech for medacine, aero space for expolration or the computer scince secotor just to name a few.For me<br> 
     being a part of an industry that is at for front of our futer and being able to work on projects that may reshape<br>
      the way we live our comincate would be amazing irispective how small or large my part. </p></div>
